Okay. 

When I first read this I read apathy, but I don’t think that is right. Sometimes I see people that know exactly what they want to do, and they are rock solid set in it. They believe it to their core, but they lack the ambition/confidence/effort to pursue it. Other time I see people abounding with effort, but with no real teleos/final destination. And they jump back and forth like a puppy. And though they have real effort, they make no progress in any particular direction. 

It sounds like you, lacking direction, fear to put in effort lest you find it wasted.

Well to the thoughts. 

You are saying a lot.

0) A Holden Caulfield-esque realization that the black and white world we learned of as children is broken 
1) A ubiquitous myopia (maybe even selfish)
2) An addiction to entertainment
3) Idealization of the past (this I disagree with) 

So what I throw back at you is: what is important? 

I agree. the world is not as fair or virtuous or simple as it was when we were children. The entire affair seems silly these days. 

And yes people do and act in selfish short sighted ways, but can you blame them? We build our castles on pillars of glass. Why would you act in a long term manner. 

And very much so yes. Entertainment is the modern pernicious addiction. It is quite scary. 

Idealization of the past. Well for most of history the vast majority of people lived similar to animals (reproducing and locally quarreling). I honestly don’t believe we are at history’s nadir. 

And as for the proliferation of destructive technology. I think it is as simple as giving a man a fish, or teaching him. If a technology teaches a man to fish, it obsoletes itself. Whereas if a technology gives a man a fish, well that fosters addiction and profit.
