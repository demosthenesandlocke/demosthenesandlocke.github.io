(Are you sure you don’t want to post this?)

Assumptions, assumptions, assumptions.

But again I ask you: how do you build a castle on shifting sands? I’ll come back to this later.

Why do we need to grow up? One of the key features of human beings is the long time to maturity. One could almost imagine longer maturation being a product of evolution. Certainly you are correct, choices and decisions that society offers to young yup are daunting, especially coming from the realms of illusion of choice that define our youth. Shit one hundred years ago most people only got the choice of: what do you want to grow when you are a farmer. And even that would be considered great choice.

So what do we do? You argue that we are lured like sailors to a sirens call to the company with the most name recognition or free food? The idea that filial piety, or that community miming, or that virtue are not present in decisions is false. All are there, and all are important. Children are still beholden to their parent, community and culture is still a large predictor of occupation, and virtue, well there is perhaps still something like virtue. Maybe not. And maybe that is what you really mean to say: virtue is dead.

First, read the Meno by Plato (not just the spark notes). The book is about the genesis and the benefit of virtue, and I quite enjoy it. Perhaps a dive into anna Karenina might be fun. But the question I ask you is: what the hell is virtue? Is it the same for everybody? Blah blah blah.

My response: virtue is dead, and so is purpose.

To the uncle. You are making a moral judgment on a man because of a white collar crime. A crime that is near arbitrarily decided by lobbyists and fatcats. Really as a human being that puts himself in a class of iconoclasts, idolizing contributing to society  should be anathema to your nature. Why contribute to a society that does not value and is fundamentally against you.

This is wrong. It is incorrect. It is amoral. Society is the enemy. It is not the lion, or the leopard, or the she wolf that fights and claws that you can nobly battle. No it is a great amalgamation of flies or ticks or leeches. There is no glory, there is no pride, there is only a filthy trudge through the swamp of time. Gradually having your individuality/soul/purpose replaced with a complacent desire to suck that desire out of others. Read Atlas Shrugged and then The Fountainhead.

Why build a castle on shifting sands?

Why save society from wasting countless hours?

Why build a castle on shifting sands?

I am honestly surprised you have such a moral drive. Where has it come from? What have you done : )? Perhaps you are grasping at purpose?

One thing that I will talk about later on is Groupism, but that will be later. And again I would like to talk about identity creation but later.

What I want to say is yes. There are problems. There are so many problems with the world. There is so much pain in society and now there is so much doubt. People act and good people come to bad ends and bad people come to good ends. And neutral people come good ends. And people that wear hats come to another. In the short run actions are often devoid of consequence. There is only random actions.

People no longer have great purpose. There is often no framework that people act under. There is no strict code, no domineering government, nor ignorance to rest upon. Instead we are left with choice. Unending unmattering choice. We are left in a world where we don’t matter and nobody cares. So what would you do? How would you build a castle on shifting sands?

People don’t have purpose anymore. There was never any real security. Death could happen at any moment, and past that there is no faith. The long term does not make sense. Perhaps it will never come. Perhaps you will want something completely different. Perhaps the sands will shift.

So why build a castle? Just build a shanty hut and lounge. Enjoy the short term. Enjoy distractions. Don’t design and believe, listen to your neighbors and do what others tell you. It is surely a safer route. They seem happy. And plump.

So what is the answer? I am almost tempted to ask.

The answer is to strike. Is to leave. Is to journey until you find a land beyond the sand and build.

The answer is to make something new. No not something. To make a new world.

Is that not correct?
