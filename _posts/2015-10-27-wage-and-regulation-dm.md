Don’t you think that there will be social/media regulation. Evil companies in the short run are profitable, but in the long run will be run out of business. 

## Demosthenes 

There were and still are things that need be regulated. But information and media in the world in a way are a police force. Some regulations are just inefficient. They cause companies to spend money jumping through hoops instead of making products. Some are excellent. The FDA is an excellent example. Imagine though if instead of making an organization to do this, instead there was some company that did FDA regulation instead. That company would charge some money to have their seal of approval on foods. And they would be responsible to check whether the food is good. If they were wrong, the media would report the story, and that company could go out of business. See here we have free market regulation. Does that not seem plausible? 

Please don’t tell me that you support raising the minimum wage….. That is just stupid. The minimum wage is just wrong. A wage subsidy sounds fine, and I think would be great policy, but not supporting a raise in the minimum wage is just common sense. The minimum wage should be eliminated no? Is not that just good economics? 

## Meno

Social/media regulation is predicated on people noticing/caring. There are ample instances of evil companies persisting because they invest in staying power through legislation, lobbying, etc. Two great examples are the soda industry and the tobacco industry. Both heavily invest in research, etc. to get protective measures. Obviously now the tobacco industry is not as powerful as it used to be, but it is still persistent probably because of addiction more than other reasons, but the soda industry is still there. I don't think its a guarantee that evil companies will be out of business in the long run without a concerted public effort as a response to someone exposing them.

This ties into the need for the FDA. I agree that a lot of regulatory agencies are inefficient, etc, but the fact of the matter is that you need an independent agency whose financial resources are not tied to the activity they are regulating. Who would finance an organization that surveyed drug trials? Companies? That would be a terrible incentive. There are numerous instances of companies funding biased research. Take financial companies paying the rating agencies to boost their ratings or the banks who set LIBOR rates manipulating them to benefit their own traders. We need independent agencies who can police institutions.

The idea of the media exposing stories is hard because there are too many instances of failure happening. The public can't be aware of everything and be the ultimate point of regulation. That is not tenable nor efficient as there is no guarantee the media/public could uncover or understand what they find. We need people whose sole job is to focus on these things. It is not an efficient use of resources or good to make the public police things. At this point the government is most "neutral" body available to provide this type of regulation. As far as the FDA goes a lot of their red tape is actually based on scientific judgement and thorough testing to ensure complete safety, etc. It may seem like a lot, but because the cost is so high, it is probably a good thing testing is so rigorous.

As for the minimum wage, of course I support it. There is actually a really large literature on this. There is not complete agreement on whether the minimum wage actually causes a loss of jobs. The empirical evidence is mixed and plenty of studies show no effect. I will say that the consensus is that a minimum wage causes a loss of jobs as in standard economic theory. The CBO which is the closest thing to a nonpartisan economics group estimated that raising the minimum wage would cost 500,000 jobs, but that is only a partial effect. Even if a minimum wage causes lost jobs there are positive effects from it that may outweigh the lost jobs. Having a minimum wage puts more money into lower income people's hands. Since they have a higher marginal propensity to spend, they will inject more of that money into the economy, leading to gains in GDP. Also, a lot of lower income people will spend money at places like Walmart, etc. that employ them in the first place, so it is not immediately clear how money these companies lose by increasing the wages paid to unskilled labor. It also is not immediately clear on the net effect of increased spending vs. lost jobs since with multiplier effects the former could be quite large. This is a paper idea I am very interested in exploring to estimate how much these companies get back. I know for a fact for example a lot of Walmart revenue comes from the government through food stamps, etc.

The fact of the matter is that even a minimum wage is not sufficient to live off of, which leads to increased reliance on welfare programs to fill the gap. With a higher minimum wage there could be less reliance of these programs, which would allow for lower taxes or the reallocation of funds to education, etc. The fact is that the standard economic model ignores a lot of other factories that are very important in judging the merits of a minimum wage.

Finally, from a social welfare perspective, a minimum wage just makes sense. Without it we will either have more poverty or more social programs which of course means more taxes for people like us anyway. Either we accept an unequal society (which empirically and theoretically is bad for economic growth in the long run), pay higher taxes to supplement the incomes of unskilled labor, or force the private sector to pay some of the higher wages which they likely get back part of anyway. I mean the type of people who work at places like KFC are honestly only going to be able to afford places like that unfortunately.

## Demosthenes 

I am also not for lobbying, and I think the conical man would not be for it as well. Small government. The government should not make laws that artificially persist lagging corporations. And I think that ironically both of your examples are of companies selling often bad products that have been seriously hurt from media and news coverage. I did not learn that cigarettes were bad in school or from the government, but from Dr. Oz and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. These organizations are truly incentivized to expose them.

Companies should be the regulators. Take the internet for example. When you go browse a web page and get a response what happens? Well a couple of things happen. You go send a ping, find the IP address, ask around how to get there, go there, get your data, send it back. And when you are sending things along, it is not through some super secure government controlled network, it is instead though routers and lines that you in fact have no control over. There are companies that provide your website a certificate that verifies that the information you receive is correct. And sometimes the companies do a shitty job. An example is one getting hacked. In less that 24 hours the company went bankrupt. 

So what did I just say. I said that there is some product that you use and trust is safe every day. All of the articles and courses and papers that you read, you got through the internet. And the only thing that protects us on the internet from man-in-the-middle attacks, are companies that paste their seal of approval on the documents that you receive. So not only can this model work, but it has. 

There are plenty of agencies that make a living off of uncovering things. The entire financial sector. The media. And anyone buying from the producer. I think that at one point, before mass media and the internet/information age I would agree. We need a big bloated government agency to take care of it. But now, I think we have moved passed the centralized era into the decentralized one (technologically speaking). 

Here is why. These agencies are subject to failures. In the past they have been corrupt and in the future that will be corrupt too. Some are probably corrupt now. Having a big centralized beast means that if it fails the entire system fails. No sane scientist would rely on just one machine. Not even the best supercomputers in the world (believe me). They would rather rely on thousands of decentralized machines. It is a simple question. Consider each person has a 50% chance of being an idiot or something. And there are about 100 million sane-ish people in the country. Then does the reliability of a government organization have to be to beat it? 1-2^-10^8. You cannot expect or ask for it. Decentralized is the way to go. A centralized model is the way of the past. 

As for the minimum wage, I don’t agree at all. I would agree to a wage subsidy, but the minimum wage is just bad. There are thousands of articles and comment sense economics is against it. It just sounds like people are complicating a model to fit their beliefs. A wage subsidy is fine. As an economist I am surprised that you would prefer a min wage instead of a wage subsidy. 

And I don’t think this consumption argument works. How by god would you measure it. Where do you think the money came from. When you raise the min wage money just does not magically appear in peoples hands right. It comes out of small businesses’ hands (or perhaps large businesses’). Regardless, businesses do spend money too. 

Wage subsidies. Employment instead of welfare. 

## Meno 

The problem with decentralization is that it just doesn't really work. A lot of the increased risk in the financial sector came about because of deregulation policies that permitted risk taking (repealing of Glass Steagall act, etc.). Also, have you ever read the Jungle by Upton Sinclair. It shows how bad the food industry was before the FDA. I agree that the internet is a decent example of self regulation, but there are government agencies behind the scenes regulating parts of it that offer consumer protection, etc. which are still very important. The internet is less regulated than other places, and there are some horrible things on it. Scams, illegal videos, etc. Also, a lot of centralized agencies have a goal to prevent bad things. Relying on media exposure is not a preventative measure. The standard economic model suggests the need for constant monitoring or at least the threat of it.

Actually for informing of health risks of tobacco, the government launched a huge anti smoking campaign that was far larger and widespread than anything else done by the media, etc. All the anti smoking commercials are from them, and the research quoted by newspapers, etc. is often government funded. The fact of the matter is we do need government sponsored research and neutral third party administrators whose funding is not tied to the organizations they are policing. That is just basic incentives, and the major problem with private regulation. I agree the government may not be the best option, but we currently don't have a more effective model. There is the potential for crowdsourcing, but that has other issues.

On the minimum wage it seems like we agree that a base wage level is important. To your first point of multiplier effects complicating the issue, that is not true. Any policy evaluation must weight all the costs and benefits and these secondary factors can actually add up when doing a cost benefit analysis. You would be surprised how many cost benefit analyses miss measure things due to omitting factors. You could measure the effects of the multipliers by surveying spending habits and the fraction of low income workers at these businesses. There are detailed surveys in the literature that get at this. Look up the fraction of food stamp spending at places like Walmart. It is quite large, so my guess is that since these large businesses employ a large fraction of unskilled labor, they will get a large amount back. Food stamps are highly correlated with low income workers. Disentangling the effects of welfare spending from the wage spending might be hard though. If I thought about this more, I really think it could work. The theoretical framework is there.

Given we agree on a base wage level, there are two ways to fund it: wage subsidies by the government or private sector minimum wage floors. Wage subsidies sound great but that money will have to come from the government which means high taxes for you and me. I feel like companies should pay the costs of this rather than taxpayers. The minimum wage is actually a hotly debated issue. Plenty of very intelligent people on both sides of the debate. It is a complicated issue with many effects that are all not immediately obvious. The fact is that standard economic theory is not well equipped to answer this question. We need more complicated models that look at the interplay of all these issues. The way things are now we cannot afford wage subsidies without a significant increase in taxes to be honest. If I were redesigning things I might do a partial wage subsidy with phasing out of welfare along with requiring employers to pay some of the costs in a mixture policy, but that will not happen now.

I do agree that welfare needs to be reformed dramatically to incentivize work more. I am not for free handouts! But it is important for people with disabilities, etc. who cannot work. There are some great welfare programs that do not discourage work as much like the EITC, but yes the programs need to be reconstructed. The problem is that things like health insurance stop automatically when someone earns a specific level of income (that is still not sufficient). What would be better is to phase out insurance, so that people do not have to choose between insurance and working. The problem is that a lot of these issues that could solve welfare problems are not politically feasible.

## Demosthenes 

It seems that I certainly do oversimplify. Or well let’s just say simplify. Whereas the truth is obviously more complex. It makes me think of Black-Scholes. We can always keep including newer and newer derivatives of change instead of simpler assumptions. But I think that there is benefit to simplicity. Perhaps not in BS option pricing, but even there. 

Instead of looking at the results, look towards the principals. 

Shoving regulation and control of products onto the government is paternalistic. Decentralized regulation is empowering and incentivizes thought and thoroughness (and great journalists like Sinclair to pop up). 

A wage subsidy will encourage hard work. A minimum wage encourages entitlement. 

We can care about the results yes, but a more long term approach will care about the ways that we take to get there. 

I know that nearly 99% of what we said, in order to arrive at the true results, would require research. There is research that goes either way for the minimum wage and perhaps some even for regulation. But consider the principals that bound them.

## Meno 

Simplified models are great for gaining insight into major factors. That is really their point. It is to understand the process being studied. They are not great for predictions. There is machine learning for that. Simplified models should never be used to make predictions without thorough testing of the assumptions and rigorous counterfactual testing. Black Scholes is a great example. It is a guiding principle into how option prices are set, but one should really never use it to trade. Or at least it needs to be greatly supplemented with other things if done so.

There are too many industries that require regulation: auto industry, pharmaceuticals, internet, stock market, insurance, mortgages, food, environment etc. The private cannot handle that on its own. Its pretty clear that in the past things were worse before the government stepped in. Also, where would money for private regulation come from? The only option is the industries being regulated which is a terrible idea. A lot of companies don't have the incentive to self regulate as we have seen. Doesn't work at all. Relying on journalism is bad because by nature it doesn't prevent things. It only exposes problems after the fact. Still obviously useful and necessary but having organizations like the FDA, etc. (more) on top of things prevents a lot of unnecessary problems.

For the wage subsidy. We both agree on a base wage level. The questions is who pays for it. A wage subsidy is paid by the government, and a minimum wage as I described it is paid by the firm. The government wage subsidy will come from taxpayers like you. Do you really think you should subsidize worker wages? I feel like the private sector should bear the cost (or at least part of it). As for a wage subsidy incentivizing work, it has the same exact incentives as a minimum wage. The worker receives the same amount regardless. The only difference is who pays for the top off, the firm or government through taxpayers.

## Demosthenes 

The argument that there are too many industries works against government regulation too. Regulation does not “prevent” things, it will only slap you if you fail. It is the threat of slapping that prevents. Same as media and private regulation. All companies have incentive to self regulate. Whether it is followed or not will show up in long term returns. 

Wage subsidies have a better incentive than the minimum wage. That means that companies can hire workers at 5 dollars an hour. Thus more hiring and more jobs. It incentivizes companies to hire and people to work. You would replace current welfare programs with wage subsidies. Implementing minimum wages means that companies that would hire plenty of people just can’t. 

You did not address the main point. Principals. The principals behind legislation direct the culture and the long long term success of a nation, a people, a company. 

## Meno 

My point about the many industries is that there is no feasible alternative to government regulation. It would be great if we could have a completely independent agency of super smart people with no incentives to regulate each industry. That is impossible though, and the closest we can get as of now is the government.

Actually regulation does prevent many, many things. Your point is just not true. Much regulation in the FDA prevents bad drugs from hitting the market and product recalls minimize the damage way before the press would find out about them. Regulation of the stock market prevents crashes. Regulation of the insurance industry prevents abuse. Regulation of banks prevents collapse of banking institutions. Industries do not have an incentive to fully self regulate. Industry wide corruption can get out of hand. Look at the financial sector numerous times. No banks had an incentive to self regulate. Rather regulation and capital requirements were and are the answer to prevent things.

We need to differ between the need for regulation, and the quality that is currently provided. Certain government regulators mean well, others do not, and some are ineffective. That does not mean regulation doesn't work, but that we need to change the rules and mechanism of the regulation.

You seem to think the private sector will work itself out in the long term. That is not necessarily true and misses the question of how long the long term actually is. Furthermore, the negative effects of working out their competition is likely too huge that it is not worth it at all. The costs of no financial regulation for example would be ridiculous. Same with many other industries. The principle of self regulation is just wrong.

Wage subsidies don't incentivize work more. Whether they lead to more employment is another question entirely. For the individual worker the decision to work or not is unaffected. Replacing current welfare with wage subsidies doesn't work completely. To get the same living standards as on both minimum wage and welfare, the government would need to spend more than it currently is because the subsidy from the private sector is gone. Its not a simple shift of cost burden. A separate question is whether the welfare system could be altered into an ever higher wage subsidy so instead of a $15 minimum wage+welfare, we could have $20 wage subsidy without welfare. Not sure about that comparison, but your argument is short sighted and too narrow. With the wage subsidy comes the issue of health insurance. If the government has to subsidize that too, then the cost burden to taxpayer just keeps growing.

Short term vs long term results misses the fact that there is a ton of state dependence. The short can greatly affect the available paths in the long term. They are not independent.

Your arguments center on the premise that the private sector is the best place for everything and will always take care of itself in a way that leads to the best interest of the economy as a whole. That principle is just wrong. We need to create rules and regulation that foster innovation while guarding against moral hazard, etc. Too much regulation does stifle growth, but the right amount can spur even more growth and keep things in check.

## Demosthenes 

Your argument: there are too many industries to regulate. The government must do it. Why? The government has more resources? Than what the private market? No. Than any one corporation, yes. But I am not suggestion a single corporation to take the lead. I would suggest government contracting of specific regulation agencies to start. An automobile regulation company. They would sell their stamp of approval to car manufacturers. The manufacturer would buy an audit and then get a rating. The rating would be a silver star. And when buyers go out and purchase a car they would look for stars. If the company did not tell the truth (could happen in government too), cars would crash, the company would loose all credibility and it would go bankrupt. Just like the regulation on the internet. Actually done this way. Very similar to the government. And there would be some set of companies like this for each industry. 

Make sense? 

The financial sector has started and does auto-regulate. Fund admins are third party services that verify the fund’s value each day. And verify the investor is not laundering money. If they do a bad job or don’t tell the truth, they go out of business. 

A government agency is nearly the same as what I defined above, except they are centralized meaning no competition, no competitive advantage, little innovation, subject to more vulnerabilities. 

Does that make sense? That is what I am suggesting. Very similar to privatizing the post office or something like that. 

I think many of your below statements are unqualified. 

"Much regulation in the FDA prevents bad drugs from hitting the market and product recalls minimize the damage way before the press would find out about them. Regulation of the stock market prevents crashes. Regulation of the insurance industry prevents abuse. Regulation of banks prevents collapse of banking institutions.”

You do not know that “regulation” prevents this or to what extent. You would have to have some sort a AB test in a nation with free and uncontrolled media (as well as good corporate laws).

That: 

"Industries do not have an incentive to fully self regulate.”

If you honestly don’t believe that, then you should go into finance. Find the industries that regulate well and those that don’t. Pair trade them. Then expose them and make a killing. If you really really believed what you said, that would be the rational thing to do.

"Certain government regulators mean well, others do not, and some are ineffective. That does not mean regulation doesn't work, but that we need to change the rules and mechanism of the regulation.” — And that is exactly what I suggest. Make it private. I would not advocate an overnight change, but I would recommend a gradual one. 

So you are saying that wage subsidies won’t incentivize companies to hire more? Or are you saying a wage subsidized salary of 10 dollars is less attractive than a minimum wage of 10 dollars? I am confused. 

Aren’t you normally talking about multipliers and secondary effects. Wage subsidies would put more people to work. More people and companies would have money to spend. Increased spending would increase taxes. Minimum wage shifting burden to employers? I doubt it. Honestly, without real evidence and a deal of it to the contrary, I believe in my economics professor and not the minimum wage. 

## Meno 

Regulation is a really big sticking point for me. I need to convince people that government regulation is both necessary and important.

The exact problem is the incentive structure your solution creates. A regulation company whose financing is dependent on the industry it regulates? That is moral hazard right there. It will lead to people paying for ratings. The cost of losing that ratings agency will be too high, and the cost of getting a new one will be too high. This is exactly how financial product ratings used to be set (they still may be). Banks would pay S&P, etc. to rate their products on the basis of safety, quality, etc. Many of those ratings are crap. We can't trust car ratings by a firm whose financial interests are tied to the companies they support. S&P didn't go bankrupt from this (and they are still doing well with not much loss in reputation). The problem is for ratings agencies their reputation is tied to the firms they regulate not consumers, so while a firm may lost business, the rating agency still has an incentive to give good ratings. We would need government regulation of the ratings agencies then and maybe that is less work than regulating the agency itself.

As a first principle its just stupid to tie financial liability of regulation companies to companies they regulate. Thats why we have an independent supreme court, Federal Reserve, why you disclose who supported research (or you are supposed too, in economics it doesn't usually happen unfortunately)...

Once the entire industry utilizes a rating agency though, thats it. You could argue for more ratings agencies to create competition. That is one potential option, but my guess is the same thing will happen since local incentive structures will be the same. We need independent auditor agencies. You could convince me to have the government pay an outside agency to do the regulation, and I would be fine with that potentially, but it really is not too different then the government doing things themselves unless you think being a more independent, smaller agency has benefits. Which it might but then you miss the power of being part of the government. If you can construct a private sector solution with NO financial ties to the industries they regulate that is a potential game changer that I will support your presidential campaign and ruler of the free world platform on.

One idea is companies pay the government that collects this in a giant pool and distributes to various independent agencies, so the government funds private sector regulation with government relational support. Not sure how well that would work though. 

Either way the government is involved. Through money or direct regulation.

Rather than link to studies on the minimum wage, I will refer you to this letter signed by some of the greatest economists: [here](http://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-statement/)

On that list is Kenneth Arrow who is arguably the greatest economist alive right now and your buddy Larry Summers

On the wage what I was trying to say is that from an individual worker perspective I get $10 both ways, so my decision of whether to work or not is the same. I don't care if my wage comes from the government or from the company.

Wage subsidies might incentivize companies to hire more. They probably would. They would lower require transfer benefits and boost tax revenues somewhat, but the majority of government spending would still be there. The minimum wage as is is not enough to live off of not to mention the lack of health care. So a wage subsidy by the government would still leave a lot of "welfare" spending on the government books. My sense is the net of these would mean more government spending and not less even with the increase in tax revenues which would be small given the huge tax reductions for low income folks anyway. Overall, the idea of a minimum wage vs. wage subsidy is really a question of who pays for the higher wages. Is its the government's job to ensure all citizens have a basic living standard or should it legally require companies to ensure it pays all employees a standard living wage. My philosophical leanings are to the latter, and it seems yours is the former. Thats fine, but a wage subsidy will require higher taxes. I will concede though that a wage subsidy would probably lead to higher employment overall. Its a balance of that with the higher taxes required to fund it (unless we cut spending somewhere else).

## Demosthenes 

Well, I must say we have thoroughly plumbed our own stores. For the regulation idea, let’s just say that I would be curious to try out some more forms of private regulation. One small step. 

On the minimum wage business, ironically I think I have to agree with you here. One reason is that yes, I don’t want the government to tax me more/shoulder more of a burden. But two, I think the minimum wage incentivizes automation. We perhaps should not incentivize people to do jobs that should be automated. Though this is not true of all jobs. For jobs that really don’t have the prospect of automation, the government might enact a wage subsidy.
