title: Changing vs. Finding
author: Locke

There's a saying in Ukrainian, "You become the people you surround yourself with."

So, doing productive things for fun is uncommon in the state college area. Why not find productive people and do them/why don't people do that? The problem with "finding" people in state college, is that most people capable or even interested in doing so are suppressed by the overall culture of apathy which would make it seem like such ideas are impossible, and thus video-games become the default choice. From the set of undergraduates capable of enjoying reading academic papers together, the overwhelming majority are uninformed/unimaginitive enough to realize that such a thing is possible; it's not in their realm of possibilities. Part of this is carry-over from high-school culture and a consequence of being absorbed into any one culture for too long(e.g. video games).

So ultimately, you can't change someone's fundamental qualitites and dispositions, but you can help them emphasize their more positive traits(thoughtfulness through questions, confidence through encouragement) as well . Creating a happy community like this is the most satisfying things I've worked on. Yes, you can certainly find kind talented individuals that already have all these things set and can incorporate them into your overall community plan, but a process of nudging someone in the right direction and getting to fully empathize with their perspective lends itself to a more intimate understanding of their being, helps you reflect/grow yourself and leads to a friendship that feels less happenstance/superficial and feels more like part of some cosmic plot.
