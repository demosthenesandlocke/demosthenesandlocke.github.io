title: Principals vs Results

I want to talk about the dichotomized weltanschauung of results and principals. What the hell did I just say.

### Eine Weltanschauung

So before I dive into pretty obfuscations, I want to really define what I mean by "dichotomized weltanshauung" (for the astute Germanophile this may may already be self-evident, however I want to add some nuance). Weltanshauung literally means a way of viewing a world, but I almost mean it to be the way that you solve any problem that the world presents you. 

For an example let's use optimization problems. You have some function and you want to find the global maximum of the function. If the world were just functions and our raison d'etre was to maximize them, then our weltanshauung would be the way that we maximize them. Newton's Method or Nelder-Mead for example. Thus I propose that viewing the world through the lens of results and principals is one such way to solve all of life's questions. I then use dichotomized to mean that these two views are incompatible but all encompassing (their intersection is the empty set and their union is the entire sample space).

But before I proceed any further I want to offer an admonition. Not all problems neatly fit into a particular weltanshauung. For example, let's return to optimization. In python, if you are trying to find a function's maximum value using a library function, then you are mostly out of luck. However, if you transform your problem into another very similar one, minimizing the negative of your original function, then you've hit a gold mine. In physics, some physical systems problems can be more easily solved by first transforming the problem into a circuits problem. Crazy right. 

So the crux of the idea is this. We should each have lot's of weltanshauungs, lots of ways of looking at and solving the worlds problems. And sometimes particular weltanshauungs work very well for solving particular problems. Therefore the more you have in your toolbox the better, and the more experience you have transforming these problems, shifting your viewpoint, the better as well. 

Whew. 

### Results vs. Principals

Now onto results and principals. First I want to completely and exactly define what I mean. In the game of results and principals our goal is to maximize value. Using a results based approach we assign value to what we get in the end. Money, fame, love, knowledge, physical health, a green light. And in the principals based approach we assign value to actions that we take. Giving, learning, exercising, breathing fire, stealing, passing out. Unfortunately in the real world we can never fully separate the two. The action of learning brings the results of knowledge (unless afflicted with an insomnia plague or something). Stealing comes with the acquisition of stuff and infamy. To convolute things further, each person often simultaneously views the world through both lenses at the same time. Meaning for each action $A$ and each result $R$ $\exists$ a value $v_p$ for each person $p$. As in everybody has some opinion about something. To further clarify, let's look at some examples. 

A man that steals and gets away with it might feel his results are good, but the principal was bad. A mother that let's her child get adopted by a more well off family might feel her results are good, but the principal was bad. On the flip side. A father that refuses to get his son a new toy might feel the principal was good but when that child throws himself down on the floor of FAO Schwarz and starts screaming sees bad results. And a daughter might refuse an act of nepotism and feel that the principal was bad but the result good. 

Because we have values associated with both, we just ask ourselves: is the principal and the result of the action worth it. If so, we do, and if not we abstain.

So I think that there is a natural question that arises: where do we get these values?

### The Genealogy of Values

I am not going to really philosophize here too much (I hope). Instead I will instantly take and assume an eschatological genesis of values. There are things that make us "happy" and positive value gives us more of these things for a longer time and negative value does the opposite. 

So it is easy to see why results have values. We get stuff that can make us happy. But why do principals? 

The way that I look at principal and result based weltanschauungs is through the lens of an investor. As an investor, one of the first things that you learn is that a sure dollar is better than a 50-50 at two dollars. There are many names for this phenomena:  risk adjusted return, volatility premium, etc. There are even quasi-statistical measures of return based on this idea: the sharpe ratio, the sortino ratio, etc. But it all comes down to this: how much risk are you willing to take to garner more return. So let's tie this back into results and principals. 

In the end I believe that we all just care about the final results, an eschatological approach. But some of us play it safer than others. Take the daughter refusing the act of nepotism as an example. I would argue that she believes that in the long run that she will be more successful if she refuses the offer. However, she could just take the job now and be done with it. Kind of similar to the idea of: would you rather have a dollar now, or flip a coin and I will give you ten dollars if it is heads. There exist people that would take both options, for the job and for the cash. And I think in the end, the idea of principals vs. results is one of risk vs. reward. 

So somebody that values a longer term payout and can tolerate more risk is more likely to have a higher emphasis on principals, whereas somebody with less risk tolerance and cares about short term payoffs will value results. 

### Final Thoughts

So next time you are making a decision, take a moment and consider whether it is based on principals or actions and why. 

Later I will discuss another weltanshauung, and after that a city of principals
