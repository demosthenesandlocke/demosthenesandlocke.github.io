Do you remember middle school?

If you do, I am sure that you remember good old Fahrenheit 451. As I read your [post]({% post_url 2015-5-4-agency-communities-changing-people-l %}) this book swarmed into my memory. The types of people you are talking about can be so clearly personified in this work Millie, the wife of our fireman is conformity. She ogles at the telewall and gossips with the neighbors and takes pills to sleep and wake. Guy Montag, our fireman (for the majority of the novel) is the "normal dude", and his quirks are the books he stashes away. And of course Clarisse McClellan is the iconoclast. Clanging with society (though perhaps coping with mania rather than dementia or angst). 

### Distinguished

So I accept your tripartite premise. As for distinguishing between the three. I wonder. It is a cocky statement to day that you would be able to classify in just a few minutes (and I would love to hear the details). But perhaps you are correct. Part of myself believes that mannerisms and quirks are a coping mechanism for coping with ennui and apathy. Vocabulary, language, stance and pose can make a rather fun game if melded correctly. But again, just a supposition. 

I have met people that I love just for their language. Not necessarily verbose or noble, but precise and exacting. Using the absolute correct word or phrase for the context. I find this beautiful. Others will appropriately harness numbers and names and figures, and give their speech an almost empirical tone. It was Hemingway in Farewell to Arms that once said (normally I paraphrase, but in writing I quote):

<blockquote>

Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.

</blockquote>

Just say abhorrent and Auschwitz and feel the difference. I find it interesting then how words lose their power as they get pulled farther and farther from their namesake (just ask our sadistic Marquis de Sade). I would like to elaborate on language and metaphor more, but we have work to do (just read Nietzsche's On Metaphor for an appetizer).

However my favorite of styles of speech is performed by Francisco d'Anconia (I leave the reference to you). The savant perfectly mixes modern slang and prose to create something more full featured and beautiful than either alone. 

All in all, I feel that I have convinced myself. You can distinguish between the three. But does that matter? 

### The Final Category

Is the final category your mafia? 

All organisms have one goal basically: to persist and spread. As a biological organism we do this basically by skoodilypooping. By reproducing we ensure our continued persistence and spread. Now at one point I want to talk about why the goal of biological organisms is this, but for now we take it as given. I claim that a mafia is but an extension of this goal. 

The way I see a member of your mafia is: somebody with your same teleos that you would like to represent you. It is like taking your soul and splitting it into another vessel. A horcrux perhaps. That is what a member in your mafia should be. Somebody that close. Somebody that you would share life with. 

Now while people in this third category, those iconoclasts, are interesting and perhaps even universally good influences, they are not and could not all be part of your mafia. Their visions and goals are different, and their modus operandi are perhaps orthogonal to your own (they have different sets of [principal and result]({% post_url 2015-05-10-principals-vs-results-d %}) values).

So again. Who should be in your mafia? 

In Plato's Republic, he talks about a philosophical aristocracy that will rule his fictional city, and part of their training is education in war, music, math, and poetry. And part is in waiting, to see whether these men will stand by justice or forsake it. What is the trial of your mafia? 

### Community Building 

I used to always say: change begets change. I would utilize changes in my environment, moves from place to place in particular, to foster new attitudes and habits. And I do believe that it worked, though sometimes I worry that I myself will become change blind and the effect of this external stimulus will deaden in time. What is also frightening is the idea of settling (in both senses). That we force our weary minds into routine and habit to give ourselves respite from thought. My muted internal monologues and mortal fear of idleness seem to be indicative of this deterioration. 

I crave what you say. I crave the ideal environment. Where introspection and self-renewal become habit (more on these later). I crave these types of men. 

How do you build this place. Well the simple idea is to physically build it, and I believe that this is completely necessary. People in proximity resonate. The lack of proximity is duly harmful to a community (I am thinking an inverse distance squared rule). And then shared purpose. A project, and small goal to hold us fast. Perhaps. I am not entirely convinced that a near term goal be necessary, but rather just an environment conducive to sharing thoughts. 

Perhaps one idea that I would like to add is aligned teleos. I believe that this is of utmost importance to creating a mafia, though not necessarily community. But more on this later. 

On final notes, how do you feel about tolerance? 

I made change the end of this a bit later, I felt a bit lost by the end.
