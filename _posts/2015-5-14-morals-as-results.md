title: Principals vs Results

Yeah, transforming your problem into the right space, or changing your perspective is critical to problem solving. Perhaps there is one global worldview that can encompass all mathematical approaches to solving a problem and have all necessary problem solving algorithms stored in the fastest portion of memory. This is sort of divided not just into fields, mathematics, statistics, but in problems in each field; say thinking everything forms a normal distribution eventually.

As I'm sure you know, all of the questions we've been talking about, Mafia and such, are simply forms of goverance, which often makes me think of a compsci/math problem in that we'd want a solution that scaled well and was elegant to implement(and to take the emotion out of it). The problem with the popular world-views is that they're not viewing the problems particularly systematically as if to solve it in general, but to simply mutate it slightly so that it might shift and make everything better but without losing their current positions of power. Really, there's a counter-example for the type of rhetoric any political side can think of, but lack of rigorous analysis for what works best in general.

Of course, with a long set of mutations we might end up with an optimal government, but I think there's almost a moral obligation on the part of our thinking capacity to find an elegant solution to the problem. After all, we only have a finite amount of cycles until whatever event inevitably kills all of humanity(unless we get the dune humans-everywhere ending).

Principle vs results, or intention vs results are both important, and inseparable, since the results are a specific implementation of the principle. The principle is the algorithm/class and must be the basis for everything that follows. The results are more or less as validation or feedback loop for your algorithm, which in our case is also the world-view/problem-space. Our need for morality, elegance and "the good" *is* one of these algorithms that's clearly very buried into our skulls to the point that everyone inherently feels they're a moral agent.

This is a conversation about our imperfect approximation of principles: Morals. The best way to live your life, which makes sense as it's the root of the Mafia and thus of any governments that come from it. As you know, morals are just another evolutionary way of trying to find the elegant, general solution to some problem. In this case, the problem is that people aren't cooperating particularly well to make themselves flourish and that the tribe with "better" morals cooperates better and thus has the larger share of the genetic pool. Clearly, morals are not an issue in a world of automated abundance. What are so many meaningless jobs for, nowadays, aside from serving as moral qualifying grounds for material goods.

In the case of the daughter's nepotic example, a bit of an aside, it might not even that the daughter believes she'd be successful, but that someone else's algorithm was to ingrain their own moral sense into their child. It's clear that morals  themselves come from a historical risk-reward regression-run in some portion of human history and for the sake of the model I'd think it was the previous generation that decided the code the next would follow. I'd argue that "safeness" or concern from results is yet another divider in moral beliefs. As soon as Alice and Bob disagree in how safe they should play, their moral algorithm is different, and of course, how it acts on their environment is a combination of some randomness whose result will {in}validate one/both of them based on result.

If we view morals as world-views/problem-spaces then the best set to instill is something similar to buddhism since it can interoperate with all other sets via generality. Practically, implementing something like that is particularly difficult since it requires a major shift in incentives and outcomes for the average American. As of now, the entire landscape seems particularly barren and deadlocked due to what seems like intellectual obfuscation.

Overall, I agree with most of your statements, which doesn't make for particularly interesting writing.
