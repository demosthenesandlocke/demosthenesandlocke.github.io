This all has to do with mafia.

A cosmic plot. You know I find that rather inspirational. There seems to be a deal of anti-individualistic sentiment brewing such that the idea of a cosmic plot/destiny is almost vain. Unless perhaps in Hari Selden’s psychohistorical view where the cosmic plot cannot be derailed by an individual. But what I mean to say is that believing in your own destiny or a story of your own making gives you a sense of importance and gives weight to your actions. It gives agency! Like some judge (don’t just read god), is viewing what you do. Like each step will somehow butterfly into greatness or destruction. Perhaps too grandiose. 

So my first question to you is: Who are these people? I think that I have found some. But for the most part they seem to show up willy-nilly. What are they like? What do they look like? Are all such people entrepreneurs, and academics and fanatics? 

My next is to agree in part. Something must truly be wrong with the world. Why is wasting time fun? Why is study a drag? Why is building work? To an extent I myself have been yoked by these tropes. Nobody says: Hey wanna read this modernist playwright together (besides a girl, now boy, that I fell in love with a few years ago). Nor do they say: Wanna read this paper on abstract models of distributed data structures together this weekend (other than academics turned educational entrepreneurs). Sometimes I feel blessed (take out the religious connotations) that I have met these people, or have been in an environment where I could meet them. But in god’s name, I go to the (purported) best academic institution in the world, yet these individuals are scarce. What must the world really be like then?

Is it culture (I do agree that it is)? And what about it (is it the desolation of agency)? (As a side note I would love to talk about the bane of being uninformed later). Has the modern world developed ADHD ([probably yes](http://2machines.com/181304/) )?

But much of this is besides the point. The point is the long debated: do people change? When I was younger I would have said: We all make choices, but in the end, our choices make us (challenge: who said that quote). I would have said yes. I found people that I believed were brilliant (for example they could memorize latin vocabulary with prodigious speed) and I latched on. I tried to convert them to my own breed of objectivism to my resounding failure. I failed twice, and I stopped altogether. Then I started to find. 

So you believe you can change people. Not entirely, but you can exacerbate certain traits (remind me to tell you of the three types of manipulation). But I believe that. And that also leads me to the idea of: mafia. But that is again for another time. Perhaps next time. 

My final question then is: How do you grow a community (or perhaps a mafia)?
