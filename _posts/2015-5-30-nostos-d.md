In ancient Greek there is a word called Nostos that means something like homecoming. 

But to truly understand what this word means, one must read the Odyssey. Read the stunningly verbose descriptions of lacrimations to gods and mortals alike. Hear of how Odysseus forsook the diefication offered by Calypso in order to return home. Home meant something back then, but now I would proclaim (in an ever so Neitzscheian way) that home is dead. 

Perhaps practically home does not mean as much. With travel and communication skyrocketing and emphasis on family and ideosyncatic local mores vanishing, home has lost its meaning.  In foreign lands we can eat, drink, talk, and act the same with impunity. But now to what I wanted to say. 

I am homeless. I feel no regard but superficial towards any location. And I feel that many of us feel the same way. So how does a man with no home feel Nostos. 

He makes one.
