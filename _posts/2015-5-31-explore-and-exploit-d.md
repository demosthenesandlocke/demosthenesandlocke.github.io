title: Explore and Exploit

Another computer science principle that I believe can be adapted to life. Again a weltanshauung. 

I want to give a simple example of something that is not generally considered an explore and exploit problem, but will highlight the fundamental ideas. I'll move on to a classic example l then the prisoner's dilemma and then to life.  

Let's say you are looking to hire an engineer for your mobile global geolocated localized cloud based big data social media startup, and you have a list of $n$ people that have given you resumes. One way is to simply interview all of the candidates. You are able to access all of their abilities and choose the best one. Thus it takes time $n$ and it is optimal. 

Another way to do it is to simply choose a candidate randomly. In this case it takes you no time (maybe time $O(1)$) and you get the best candidate with probability $1/n$. If we make an assumption like: candidates' skill are distributed uniformly between $0$ and $1$ wlg (without loss of generality), then our random candidate will have an expected skill of $1/2$ and our maximum candidate will have an expected skill of (maximum of $n$ uniforms) ($n/n+1$). Therefore we have created a Monte Carlo algorithm to solve this problem that is an expected $1/2 \mathbb{OPT}$. 

The first deterministic algorithm is an example of completely focusing on exploring. We explored the entire space to find the real optimum. The second is an example of only exploiting. We did not explore the space at all and directly sought to start reaping the rewards of having a developer. Let's go one more step forward. 

Now let's create a Monte Carlo algorithm with a specific probability $p$ of success. We know that if we interview some fraction $k n$ of the total population then we will have a $(1-1/n)^{nk}$ chance of not finding our optimum. We can bound this with $e^{-k}$, and therefore have an lower bound of $1-e^{-k}$ probability of success if we interview $k n$ people. 

Then the question becomes: well what probability $p$ do I want? Well that depends. If you really want to start quickly, then you will need to sacrifice quality. However if you need the best guy out there then perhaps you want to interview them all. An even more plausible scenario is that you have some acceptable range of quality and you want to promise whp (with high probability) that your man or woman is in that range. But you should clearly now see the trade off between exploring and exploiting. 

The more canonical version of his problem is an oil tycoon. We probe the area for oil to find a good drilling location. The question is: how many probes do we do? Where do we do them (near a local maximum or far away)? When we decide to drill, how long do we stay in the same place (till dry or perhaps half done)? You should be able to smell optimization all over this problem, and rightly so. A very challenging question is: I am currently at a local maxima, how certain am I that this is the global one?

But let's leave that there for now. 

The final example that I want to bring up is a variant of the classic prisoner's dilemma problem (I will leave background to you).  My variant is a noisy prisoner's dilemma. Consider: you are using bit torrent with one other party. You have the best movie ever, James Cameron's Avatar and he has a copy of an equally good movie, Wes Anderson's the Grand Budapest. Each of you want to download your movie first. You can devote bandwidth to uploading the movies or downloading the movies. An optimal strategy, the cooperating strategy, would be to upload and download in equal amounts. A defecting strategy (just helps you) would be to only download and use the rest of you resources to stream music or something. And of course the double defecting strategy is where both parties are simply waiting to download. 

The noisy part of this solution is that the Internet connection is not so good. So sometimes the other party will choose to upload, but you will see no upload progress being made. 

Therefore a simple solution of: stop uploading when your opponent stops (grim trigger strategy), would not work well in this environment. So what do you do? You explore and exploit. If you see your opponent defect, you might explore and continue to cooperate next round. Yes there is the potential of not recovering, but there is also the possibility that the previous defect was just noise. 

Hopefully by now you have realized just how versatile the explore and exploit strategy truly is. Nearly any problem can be converted to the weltanshauung of explore and exploit. Choosing a major, trusting a cheat, Civilization. 

But what I really want to apply it to is this middle goal. And that is for next time.
