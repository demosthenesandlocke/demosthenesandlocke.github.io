Well, clearly these people are all romantics!

I would identify someone as how well they conform to the status-quo. The status-quo being an imaginary set of values we all interpret through the aggregate of standard media outlets' messages. These messages are filtered to us through every digital orifice those pesky marketers can find. So really, all you need to do is find ways in which people consciously or sub-consciously deviate from any of the shallow values presented to us through the animated-pictures industry.

People do change; they *must* react to their environment. I believe this may be the only thing that makes one change. Put the average non-thoughtful man in an ideal academic environment and he will become academic himself, but put too many of them and you destroy the environment. Of course, this wouldn't work if there were pre-existing biases, since those need their own specific conditions to be removed. My cultural observations are only valid as far as the University setting are concerned. I noticed a similar trend in my previous workplace(but it might be just people accepting the world at that age, which freaks me out). The individual agency here must be to change some aspect of one's environment to make it conform to themselves, which can often end up flawed or incomplete(e.g. people trying to lose weight).

At the same time, some ideas are easier to change at some ages than others, given ideal conditions. I think this is clear enough.

In your specific Latin case, what was the driver for them to change? There was nothing pressing about their goals that was affected by what you were telling them, and if they're particularly focused it may seem like a hindrance to think about. Furthermore, your tolerance for difference, so far we have only qualified that the "person" must be open minded/naive enough to enjoy something categorized as work. I used to think you could rely solely on agency to achieve your own ends. This is only true if you recogize that having initiative and doing something uncomfortable is inherently difficult, which is sort of the "work is not fun" mentality but with any unfamiliar activity. The habit must be made actively but maintained passively.

How do you grow a community? This is something I've been trying to find ways to do. There are also different locales we can define (like forum community vs neighborhood community), but once you've gathered these open-minded and thoughtful individuals, you need to create some collective work or need to bind them together, which may or may not also create geographic bounds. e.g. My fraternity and housing, with the qualifier of being an engineer, Summer code house due to the math/phys double-majors needing more marketable skills but also having ambition.


It was tricky to write this because a lot of the categories could be felt but were difficult to concretely define. I might edit this later.
