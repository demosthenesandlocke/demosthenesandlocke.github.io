title: What is home
author: Locke
---

We've covered home previously, so I'll quickly recap home in that context: Home is a set of world-views you identify with combined with people(family) that won't leave you. Home brings a feeling of belonging from being part of a tribe.

Futurists have argued that communities will not be defined by borders as much as ideological idenfification due to informational ubiquity. Though it is true that many virtues shared by past generations such as filial piety have lost favor, a modern, hubtistic sentiment is that we've somehow evolved past a need for physical interaction or actual families. This is very much the flip-side of idealizing the past(a cognitive slip I'm fond of).
But that's not the point, it's not the rules themselves but the concepts they strive towards that have the real significance: the virtues in question. I have not identified a particularly good modern version to latch on to, which as I've argued is largely due to our modern inability to form a new set of general "morals/rules" against the black hold of misinformation and entertainment.

So if you're trying to create a new home, you'd need to create a set of (ideally general) axioms to draw your rules from. You could latch onto your favorite philosopher and his form of goverance, or perhaps pick a certain nation as being your favorite, but being computer scientists we ought to find the parameters that make a successful society: mutually beneficial outcomes, ideological propagation, widespread participation, living satisfaction, ..., quantify, put in a linear system, solve. Of course, the virtues that make a "successful" society are up to debate, but there's no point in copying a template and hoping for success. Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise, instead seek what they sought.

Ignoring the issue of spreading such a message in a modern day society. We should probably discuss what objects people ought to strive towards in
